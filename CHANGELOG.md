# Changelog

## 0.15.1

Test-coverage pass (94% -> 97% statement+branch) and two request-validation fixes.

- Fix: a tool `type` that is a list or object (e.g. `{"type": [["x"]]}`) crashed pre-flight
  validation with `TypeError` (a 500 from the service) instead of `InvalidRequestError`.
- Fix: a tool name with a trailing newline (`"search\n"`) passed validation because the name
  pattern used `$`; it now uses `fullmatch`.
- Tests: tool-validation rejection branches with hypothesis properties, Groq/OpenAI request
  options, breaker-open paths, tracing never-raise, privacy message mapping, Vertex credential
  dispatch. `pytest-cov` and `hypothesis` are dev dependencies; coverage floor 96%.

## 0.15.0

Privacy layer (`llm_gateway.privacy`, opt-in; existing calls are unchanged).

- `PrivacyLayer` wraps `complete_with_usage`, `chat` and `stream_chat` with reversible redaction
  (per-call in-memory `Vault`), per-call output policies (`RESTORE`, `STRIP`, `PASSTHROUGH`),
  strict mode (`PrivacyPolicyMissingError`), structured-output and tool-argument handling, and a
  counts-only audit hook.
- Hardening over the first draft: a placeholder-shaped literal in the input is reserved so it can
  never restore to another value; kinds with `_`/digits no longer leak unmatched tokens and
  invalid kinds raise `ValueError`; restored values in streamed tool-call arguments are
  JSON-escaped; held-back text is flushed before the finishing delta; multi-character
  delimiters split across chunks are held; the vault is cleared even if closing the stream fails.

## 0.14.1

Docs and typing pass; no behavior change.

- Ship `py.typed`, so type checkers use the package's inline annotations.
- Typing fixes: `stream_chat()` is annotated `AsyncGenerator[StreamDelta, None]`; `GatewayConfig.policy`
  passes validated provider-id tuples; price scaling and the `tool_choice` check no longer rely on
  `None`/`object` narrowing.
- README: error reference (class, when raised, retried?), the missing policy/price/`SSL_VERIFY`
  environment variables, and `SECURITY.md` (secret handling, how to report a vulnerability).
- Tests run the README's library examples against fake providers and check that every public
  error is documented.

## 0.14.0

Agentic pass.

- New `InvalidRequestError` (an `LLMError` and `ValueError`; the service answers 400). `chat()` and
  `stream_chat()` now validate before any provider call: tool names and uniqueness, JSON Schema
  structure of `parameters` (type, enum, required, properties, anyOf), `tool_choice` naming a
  known tool, and tool-call/tool-result pairing (orphan or duplicate result, missing
  `tool_call_id`, unanswered parallel call). Previously these became a provider 400 that failed
  over and counted against the breaker, or a bare `KeyError` on Anthropic.
- Anthropic and Vertex Claude: `tool_choice="none"` on a history that already holds tool calls
  keeps the tool definitions and sends `{"type": "none"}`; omitting them made Anthropic reject
  the request.

## 0.13.3

Correctness pass.

- Streaming (OpenAI-compatible providers): usage sent on the last chunk that also carries
  `choices` (Mistral and other hosts) is no longer dropped, so tokens, cost and quota are counted.
- Streaming (Anthropic, Vertex Claude): tool-call `index` is now the tool-call ordinal from 0,
  not the content-block index, so text before a tool call no longer shifts indexes.
- Non-streaming OpenAI-style providers: malformed or non-object tool-call arguments raise
  `InvalidOutputError` (fails over, no breaker count) instead of an unclassified `UNKNOWN` error.
- Structured output: a reply with a sentence before or after the JSON, or a fence inside prose,
  now parses; the strict parse still runs first and unusable text is still rejected.
- Anthropic: system messages given as a list of text parts no longer raise `TypeError`.

## 0.13.2

Reliability pass.

- Streaming: closing or cancelling the consumer (client disconnect, `break`) now closes the
  provider's generator, so the upstream request and connection are released instead of leaking.
- Streaming: a failure after the first chunk now counts toward the provider's circuit breaker
  (it was invisible before), then propagates unchanged.
- Service: a raw (non-`LLMError`) error mid-stream ends the SSE response with a generic error
  event and `[DONE]` instead of dropping the connection; the engine is closed via `aclosing`.
- Retry: backoff is jittered (50-100% of the doubling delay) and honors a provider's
  `Retry-After` (seconds, capped at 60 s) when longer; a wait that doesn't fit the call deadline
  gives up instead of sleeping.
- Circuit breaker: a real half-open state. After the cooldown exactly one probe call is admitted
  (`breaker.allow`); the rest stay out until it succeeds (closes) or fails (re-opens). State
  changes are lock-protected. A lost probe's lease expires after one cooldown.

## 0.13.1

Security pass.

- Provider API keys and `GATEWAY_API_KEYS` no longer appear in `repr()`/`str()` of `GatewayConfig`.
- Provider error text is scrubbed (`errors.redact_secrets`) before it enters `LLMError` messages,
  span statuses and the service's 503 body: configured keys, bearer tokens, `api-key: ...` pairs and
  common key shapes.
- Service auth: a non-ASCII bearer token returns 401 instead of a 500.
- Service: tool-call arguments and tool definitions count toward `MAX_PROMPT_CHARS`; `max_tokens` must be >= 1.
- Hostile JSON (deeply nested model output or tool-call arguments) raises `InvalidOutputError` /
  `ValueError` instead of `RecursionError`.
